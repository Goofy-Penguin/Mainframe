# Mainframe

This library was a effort to learn about technical aspects and flows regarding creating an engine for Games and Apps.
The structure resembles how the old [XNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_XNA) worked, and from there add more features and tools to make it easier to start a simple OpenGL Game/App.

The project consists of:
- Database connector for MySQL/MariaDB for server-like programs
- Game framework to provide a main-loop with `update`/`draw` structure
- Networking providers to more easy create a server and provide an easy method of sending and receiving interfaces of data
- Various 3D and 2D math operations
- Rendering utilities for OpenGL and imaging
- Easy UI system that offers advanced customization and functionality

The project has been abandoned since, but still stands decently feature complete for what we initially intended it to be.
